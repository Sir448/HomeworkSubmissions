Script to split pdfs into separate questions (i.e. for math homework) to make it easier to upload

You must follow strict formatting to use. Must use same file structure as me. Must type the question number at the top left of the first page of each new question.
You must also enable the Google Drive API on your account before you use this. You will get a credentials.json file which you must put in the same directory. The first time you use this, you will also get a token.pickle file.
If you want to use this code for yourself, message me and I can help you change it for your own use.
